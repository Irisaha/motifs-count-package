This a fast, c++ based, motif count toolbox. The included functions counts motifs of orders 3 and 4 in binary directed networks in the scales of single vertex and the total network.The algorithm is detailed in:Itzhack Royi, Yelena Mogilevski, and Yoram Louzoun. "An optimal algorithm for counting network motifs." Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 381 (2007): 482-490. Yoram Louzoun's lab: http://peptibase.cs.biu.ac.il/Royi Itzhack's homepage: http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~itschar/Before applying the algorithm the input graph is converted to the graph object ofLev Muchnik's complex networks toolboox:http://www.levmuchnik.net/Content/Networks/ComplexNetworksPackage.htmlThe software runs on windows 64 bit, the mex files were compiled with visual studio 2013.Source files are included. To compile them in different systems enter "mex evaluate3motifs.cpp mex3motifs.cpp" for 3 motifs."mex Evaluate4motifs.cpp mex4motifs.cpp" for 4 motifs.
